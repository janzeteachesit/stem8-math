# BIG – IDEA: NUMBER & FLUENCY

Number represents, describes, and compares the quantities of ratios, rates, and percent. Computational fluency and flexibility extend to operations with fractions

## STEM Core Math: Fractions / Decimals / Percent

### BC Content Area: Percent

·less than 1 and greater than 100 \(decimal and fractional percent\)

·What is ½% of 1 billion?

·The population of Vancouver increased by 3.25%. What is the population if it was approximately 603,500 people last year?

### BC Content Area: Fractions

·operations with fractions \(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and order of operations\)

·includes the use of brackets, but excludes exponents

·simplifying ½ ÷ 9/6 x \(7 – 4/5\)

### BC Content Area: Ratio

·numerical proportional reasoning \(rates, ratio, proportions, and percent\)

·two-term and three-term ratios, real-life examples and problems

·A string is cut into three pieces whose lengths form a ratio of 3:5:7. If the string was 105 cm long, how long are the pieces?
