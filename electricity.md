## related to Content Learning Standards.  These are the things KNOWN about Math.

BIG – IDEA: ELECTRICITY | PCBI | ABI | AAC | ACAT
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
Circuits | . | . | . | . 
Voltage, Current, and Resistance | . | . | . | . 

- PCBI = PARTIALLY COMPLETE BUT INACCURATE
- ABI = ACCURATE BUT INCOMPLETE
- ABC = ACCURATE AND COMPLETE
- ACAT = ACCURATE, COMPLETE, AND THOROUGH
